1. The most interesting topic covered so far is understanding fire spread and how that is modeled in prediction models.
2. I would love to further explore how wildfire spread patterns are affected by different features (how does spread change based on wind speed, terrain, fire type, fuel type, etc.).
3. I would like to be more hands on with data in the Quarter 2 Project. The Quarter 1 project was more about learning and understanding wildfire science and wildfire modeling. 
4. I would be interested in using techniques like upscaling to modify and explore data at different aspects and specificities.
